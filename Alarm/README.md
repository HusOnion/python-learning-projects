# Python Alarm Clock ⏰

A simple command-line alarm clock built with Python.  
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice working with time, user input, and external libraries.

## Features
- Set an alarm using `HH:MM:SS` format
- checks the system time
- Plays an audio file when the alarm time is reached

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pygame (just for audio playback)

## How It Works
1. The user enters a time in `HH:MM:SS` format
2. The program checks the current system time every second
3. When the time matches, an alarm sound is played

## Requirements
Of course, make sure you have pygame installed
This is the command if you don't know:
pip install pygame
